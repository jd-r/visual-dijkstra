This project was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is based on Clement Mihailescu's [Pathfinding Visualizer project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial).

It is a web app that helps you visualize how dijkstra's algorithm works, it then finds the shortest path from one node to another and that path is animated with css animations.

All the code can be located in /src/Visualizer.
