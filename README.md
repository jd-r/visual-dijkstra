This project was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is based on Clement Mihailescu's [Pathfinding Visualizer project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial).

It is a web app that helps you visualize how dijkstra's algorithm works, it then finds the shortest path from one node to another and that path is animated with css animations.

All the code can be located in /src/Visualizer.

## Serve this app
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is required. <br />
- clone the repo and `cd visual-dijkstra` into app.
- Type `npm install`. This builds the app because of `"postinstall": "react-scripts build"`in package.json.
- Type `node app.js` to serve the app at `http://localhost/8080`.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
